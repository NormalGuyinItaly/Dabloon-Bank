When you add a Dabloon you can close the exe file without worrying since the progress are saved in dabloons_bank.txt
When clicking 3 you can see the rules and they are :
- No infinite Dabloons
- There are only normal Dabloons (No ultimate etc.)
- You can give only the max of 100 Dabloons per video
- You can't give Dabloons you don't have
- If someone breaks the rules, report them to the Dabloon Police officers
